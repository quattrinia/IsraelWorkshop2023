#you might get an error related to a collections.hashable comment, if so, you need to update a script. more info can be found here, and I am happy to help with this:
https://github.com/ablab/spades/issues/873
#if you can fix this, then rerun spades.

#if you get another error related to OS return value: 22, then we need to run spades by itself, not in conda.

#I add nohup which means "nohang ups", so you can then run spades in the background of your computer (you can close terminal, close your computer, and it will still run.
Also, change # threads to the number of threads you have on your local machine
#Permission errors might still ensue on a Mac, we can go over them in person

#When the run completes (just a few hours)
