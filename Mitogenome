#We are going to use Novoplasty and Mitofinder to assemble mt genomes

First you need to download reference data from genbank. For Novoplasty, you need a seed file and I suggest COI.

Serach COI and Swiftia-download to a fasta formatted file.

For Mitofinder, you need fully formatted genbank files. Go to REfSeq and then download a ~20 full mitogenomes. 
Search for Octocorallia and mitochondrion

#We are also going to blast for mt genome sequences in our spades assembly. 
#First you need to create a blast database of octocoral mt genome sequences
makeblastdb -in ../../refs/coi_seed.fasta -out ../../refs/coi_seed -dbtype nucl
blastn -db coi_seed -query IZ_S104.contigs.fasta -outfmt 6
