#We are going to use Novoplasty and Mitofinder to assemble mt genomes

First you need to download reference data from genbank. For Novoplasty, you need a seed file and I suggest COI.

Serach COI and Swiftia-download to a fasta formatted file.

For Mitofinder, you need fully formatted genbank files. Go to REfSeq and then download a ~20 full mitogenomes. 
Search for Octocorallia and mitochondrion

We are also going to blast for mt genome sequences in our spades assembly. 

conda install -c bioconda blast
