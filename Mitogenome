####We are going to use a Spades-based Blast to find mitgenonme and either Novoplasty or Mitofinder to assemble mt genomes###

First you need to download reference data from genbank. For Novoplasty, you need a seed file and I suggest COI.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
Serach COI and Swiftia-download to a fasta formatted file.

#We are first going to blast for mt genome sequences in our spades assembly. 
#First you need to create a blast database of octocoral mt genome sequences
makeblastdb -in ../../refs/coi_seed.fasta -out ../../refs/coi_seed -dbtype nucl
blastn -db ../../refs/coi_seed -query ../spades/IZ_S104/IZ_S104.contigs.fasta -outfmt 6 -out blast_IZ104

#open your blast_IZ104
less blast_IZ104
#quit less
q
grep "NODE_2_length_18790_cov_17.556779" -A 100 ../spades/IZ_S104/IZ_S104.contigs.fasta
#Copy the contig and put into a new file. How would you do this?


######NOVOPlasty assembly####
cd results
mkdir novoplasty
cd novoplasty
#you need to manually alter your config.txt file
#cd into the directory where you installed NOVOplasty
cp config.txt pathto/results/novoplasty
nano config.txt
#edit config file
perl /Users/quattrinia/Applications/NOVOPlasty/NOVOPlasty4.3.1.pl -c config.txt

###Annotate Spades assembly and Novoplasty assembly with Mitos2###
#go to http://mitos2.bioinf.uni-leipzig.de/index.py
#upload data, choose correct translation table (4 for mold and coelenterates) and RefSeq 89 Metazoa
#Wait for the results!
#Question-How can we use these data to help identify (molecularly) our specimen?

######Mitofinder assembly#######
#You need fully formatted genbank files. Go to REfSeq and then download a ~20 full mitogenomes. 
#Choice of this db really depends on what mitogenomes you are assembling. 
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/
#Search for octocorallia and mitochondrion
cd results
mkdir mitofinder
cd mitofinder
#We are going to assemble the mitogenome based on trimmed reads. Alternatively, you can always pass a spades contig.fasta
file to mitofinder. Check instructions. Mitofinder installation is very tricky-if you were successful, do this in practice, if
not, just follow along with me. We will discuss the benefits of using htis approach.
