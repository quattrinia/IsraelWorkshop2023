####We are going to use a Spades-based Blast to find mitgenonme and either Novoplasty or Mitofinder to assemble mt genomes###

First you need to download reference data from genbank. For Novoplasty, you need a seed file and I suggest COI.

Serach COI and Swiftia-download to a fasta formatted file.

#We are first going to blast for mt genome sequences in our spades assembly. 
#First you need to create a blast database of octocoral mt genome sequences
makeblastdb -in ../../refs/coi_seed.fasta -out ../../refs/coi_seed -dbtype nucl
blastn -db ../../refs/coi_seed -query ../spades/IZ_S104/IZ_S104.contigs.fasta -outfmt 6 -out blast_IZ104

#open your blast_IZ104
less blast_IZ104
#quit less
q
grep "NODE_2_length_18790_cov_17.556779" -A 100 ../spades/IZ_S104/IZ_S104.contigs.fasta
#Copy the contig and put into a new file. How would you do this?

######Mitofinder assembly#######
#You need fully formatted genbank files. Go to REfSeq and then download a ~20 full mitogenomes. 
#Choice of this db really depends on what mitogenomes you are assembling. 
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/
#Search for octocorallia and mitochondrion
cd results
mkdir mitofinder
cd mitofinder
#We are going to assemble the mitogenome based on trimmed reads. Alternatively, if
mitofinder -j IZ_S104 -1 ../
